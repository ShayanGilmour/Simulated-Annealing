# Simulated Annealing Solving Traveling Salesman Problem

Solving Traveling Salesman Problem with Simulated Annealing. In simulated annealing, we have point which is cruising the domain of a function. Here, the function is the cost function: The length of the cycle. And the point, which is a corresponding permutation of a cycle, is moving going to adjacent points in the domain. Here, adjacent point is just a similar permutation: Swapping 2 numbers of the permutation.

Here we have a set of cities:

Here I've monitored the answer produces by simulated annealing over `200000` iterations (Less than `2s`).
